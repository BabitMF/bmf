### bmf- aesthetic assessment demo

Our aesthetic assessment model is trained on Aesthetic Visual Analysis dataset (AVA), a large-scale subjective aesthetic dataset commonly used in academia which contains 250K photographs with diverse themes. Each image has a peer-review rating of 100-200 professional users. 

Our deep learning model Aesmode has achieved a binary classification accuracy of 83.8% on AVA dataset, reaching the level of academic SOTA, and can be directly used to evaluate the aesthetic degree of videos by means of frame extraction processing.

This demo shows how to invoke our aesthetic assessment model using bmf. Try on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/BabitMF/bmf/blob/master/bmf/demo/aesthetic_assessment/aesmod_bmfv3_fin.ipynb).
