The video begins with the logo Big Buck bunny in a large blue cartoonish font. The camera pans down from fluffy pink clouds down into a vibrant green and dark green forest and shows off the lush green grass where the sun rays make them glow. A creek is then shown, with floating lilypads, multiple pink flowers with yellow centers and cat tails blooming along the side. A small fly is seen flying about. Then a purple fluffy bird squeaks while sitting on a branch before suddenly hit by an acorn in the head which makes it dazed and fall off. Then a grassy mound with a tree growing on top is shown, that has a small dark entrance where a big cartoon bunny is seen sleeping and waking up. It gets up and starts stretching, before walking off.
